step 1: Include the fsrteam library (The library used for file handling)
step 2: create an object of the fstream class
step 3: specify the path and mode of operation of the file like ""Syntax for file creation: FilePointer.open("Path",ios::mode);"" 
eg:
file opened for writing: st.open("D:\filename.txt",ios::out);
here, filename.txt is the name of the file and ios::out is the mode of operation
